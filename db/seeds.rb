# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rake db:seed (or created alongside the db with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   cities = City.create([{ name: 'Chicago' }, { name: 'Copenhagen' }])
#   Mayor.create(name: 'Emanuel', city: cities.first)
# Season.create(year: 2000)
# Team.create(br_id: "ATL")
# Player.create(name: "Billy")
# SeasonTeam.create(season_id: 1, team_id: 1)
# Membership.create(season_id: 1, team_id: 1, player_id: 1, salary: 1000000)
